# Islandora Scholar Profiles

This module automatically generates a profile page for each Person entity in an Islandora repository. The profile is automatically populated with biographical information from the MADS datastream and a list of publications (drawn from objects with a defined relationship to the Person entity). Scholars can request changes to information in their profile using an associated webform. An optional submodule imports a taxonomy of research interests drawn from the NCES research classification schema, which can be used in conjunction with Person entity ingest forms. Finally, the module automatically generates a "Scholar's Directory" using a custom Solr query to create a searchable gallery view of all Person entities.
